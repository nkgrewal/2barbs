This love story, like many of our generation, starts with cyber-stalking. 

As some of you know, Bridget was not initially very forthcoming at first about how she and Max met. It was vaguely alluded to that they “met online,” and this was the story I was familiar with until about a year ago. 

**THE LIES.** This post will fix that.

Let me paint a picture. The year was 2010. Back when 93.3 FM was Seattle's only hip-hop station, despite no one listening to the radio anymore, Rihanna had us all fooled that she would only release one album where she'd overuse “na-na”; Ludacris was unwittingly asking a pre-Trump-as-a-presidential-nominee nation the hauntingly accurate question of “How low can you go?”; and Kanye was just starting to really rev up whatever the hell it is Kanye does.

## Chapter 1 - Since I’m writing this it will mostly be about me.
I had just moved to Seattle for my first full-time job out of college. I know you’re all wondering: Was I scared? Nervous? Ready to take on the challenges of the big city that lay before me?

Meanwhile, Bridget was on Facebook liking music videos. She left a one-word comment on song called “Misty” on a public page for Ella Fitzgerald. 

What was this magical, amazing, one-word comment that’s apparently the cause of this long-ass post? For $300, I’ll tell you. Just find me at the wedding and bring cash.

I’ve never heard this song, but I figure we all should now since I’m writing about it…

As tends to happen on the internet, when a girl publicly comments on something, a private message from some creepy rando is inevitable. The message she got was, “You won’t need to open the door, we’ll come through the window.” 

Oh, wait, no, that one was from me... 

Don’t worry about it. 

The message she got from the rando was, “If you liked that, you should watch this video by Nina Simone!”

She checked to see if she knew this rando or if they had mutual friends. They did not. Who was this handsome, baseball-capped stranger with impeccable taste in music?

## Chapter 2 - #legitbreaching
Rather than ignore the message like you should on the internet, Bridget decided to keep talking to this person. I mentioned I was in Seattle, because this is what happens when I’m not around. 

They continued to message back and forth about the old people’s music that they liked, sharing links then other interests then stories about themselves. This rando told Bridget at one point about a Goonies movie event in Seattle.

Some of you may know, Bridget has a very casual, passing interest in this children’s classic that came out the year she was born. She suggested that they see the movie together, not having her heart set on it at all, and he shot her down. 

And that was the last she heard of Alex A-Rod Rodriguez. 

## Chapter 3 - lol j/k
We all know at this point that the rando was actually Max. He did shoot her down though. Like hard. She still hasn’t let it go, so it’ll be hilarious if you bring it up repeatedly during the wedding.

They continued to talk, despite that harsh rejection, as friends. Especially since he had a girl in his profile pic, some ridiculously pretty girl that I made fun o-NOPE WAIT, IT’S REBECCA. Disregard lol.

Bridget eventually found out it wasn’t his girlfriend but his sister, Rebecca. And also that Rebecca had the same picture as her profile pic. Yes, Bridget had already creeped on her Facebook. Classic social-media-fueled misunderstanding. But she found out the truth, and just in time! She was seriously starting to feel this internet rando that liked old people’s music and Goonies just as much as she did. Hawt.


## Chapter 4 - Hug or High-Five? A 9/11 date
In the true fashion of internet romances, it was time to take this thing offline. Time to meet IRL. They scheduled a date so sizzling hot the initials read ‘TSSSS’: The Second Saturday of September in Seattle. 

Also, turns out that was 9/11. 

Thought that was worth bringing up before I continued the story.

Bridget made the trip down to Seattle with no idea of what this date would entail. Max promised to plan it all but kept the plans a surprise. They met up downtown for what would fondly be referred to from then on as “Megadate,” because apparently the name “9/11 Date” is “inappropriate” and “Navreen, stop saying that”. 

It was a 17-hour super-date that would have been incredibly awkward if they hated each other at first sight.

<div class="post-media" markdown="0"><img src="{{ site.url }}/wlog/images/megadate1.jpg" alt="Megadate1" /><span class="caption">Check the time stamp.</span></div>

Before they met, Max texted Bridget and asked that question that plagues everyone before their first date: “Hug or high-five?” She replied “Both.” The magic continued from there. 
<div markdown="0" class="sidebar pull-right">
<p><strong>Dating math!</strong> If the average date is 2-3 hours, then Bridget and Max essentially did 5-8 back-to-back dates in one day.</p>

<p>That’s 2.5-4 dating units per person, and 30 seconds of your life you’ll never get back because you took the time to read this sidebar!</p>

Their funderful day included the Seattle Underground tour, drinks at the W, Gameworks, Elliott Bookstore, dinner at Benihana under the reservation “hollywoo”, and finally drinks in Capitol Hill. Personally, I would have (and actually have) deeply resented anyone that would make me do more than one social thing in a week, let alone five in one day, but Bridget was pretty into it.


## Chapter 5 - Moral of the story is cyberstalking works out sometimes.
But alas, although they had 5-8 amazing dates in one day, they were so far from each. She was in Ferndale, he was in Seattle. 
<div class="post-media pull-right" markdown="0"><img src="{{ site.url }}/wlog/images/toon1.jpg" alt="Latkas" width="340" /><span class="caption">I think this happened at some point?</span></div>

They visited each other as they could, but they may as well have been star-crossed lovers from stories of old (stay tuned for the balcony scene*). 

Her heart aching, Bridget did the only thing a girl could do in this situation. She found a job in Sodo and stayed with some weird loner in Kirkland that was 3 bottles of solo-wine-drankin’ away from adopting 20 cats (this guy). 

Between long commutes, long phone calls home, and long weekdays until they could see each other again, they made the jump to move into together in West Seattle, and the rest melds into good memories shared with good people.

On B’s 30th birthday, just before she had a full-on “my-20s-are-gone-and-they’re-allegedly-never-coming-back” crisis, Max proposed. He played that same Ella Fitzgerald song that pulled them to randomly message each other on Facebook. At 2 a.m. on their balcony, they danced to it while overlooking the waters towards downtown, the place they first saw each other face to face (*re: the balcony scene).

Remember that one-word comment on a Facebook post I mentioned in the beginning of this story? The one that Bridget left on a song, and I was going to charge $300 for? 

Well, since you made it this far, I’ll just tell you. This story started literally with a one-word comment on a Facebook page and the willingness to take a chance. That word was “beautiful” and it truly encapsulates their story.

Come this fall, we get to see two incredible, wonderful, funny, goofy, loving, genuine, crazy, caring, goofy, fun, kind, mischievous, heart-warming (and did I mention goofy?) people officially start their lives together with all their friends, family, and probably Ella herself from up above cheering them on.

So now that you know, just give me a $20 when you see me at the wedding and we’ll call it good ;)
